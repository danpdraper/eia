ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT ACT
An Act to set out the general principles, procedure and methods to enable the prior consideration of
environmental impact assessment on certain public or private projects.
[1992 No. 86.]
         [10th December, 1992]  
[Commencement. ]
PART I
    General principles of environmental impact assessment
1. Goals and objectives of environmental impact assessment  
The objectives of any environmental impact assessment (in the Act referred to as "the assessment") shall be‐  
(a)   to establish, before a decision is taken by any person, authority, corporate body or   unincorporated
body, including the Government of the Federation, State or local   government intending to undertake or
authorise the undertaking of any activity, those   matters that may likely or to a significant extent affect the
environment or have an   environmental effect on those   activities and which shall first be take into account;  
(b)   to promote the implementation of appropriate policy in all Federal Lands  
(however acquired) States and local government areas, consistent with all laws    and decision‐
making processes through which the goal and objective in       paragraph (a) of this section may
be realised;  
(c)   to encourage the development of procedures for information exchange,  
notification and consultation between organs and persons when proposed     activities are
likely to have significant environmental effects on boundary or     trans‐State or on the environment
of bordering town and villages.  
2. Restriction on public or private project without prior consideration of the environmental impact  
(1) The public or private sector of the economy shall not undertake or embark on or authorise projects or
activities without prior consideration, at an early stage, of their environmental effects.  
(2) Where the extent, nature or location of a proposed project or activity is such that it is likely to
significantly affect the environment, its environmental impact assessment shall be undertaken in accordance with
the provisions of this Act.  
(3) The criterion and procedure under this Act shall be used to determine whether an activity is likely to
significantly affect the environment and is therefore subject to an environmental impact assessment.  
(4) All agencies, institutions (whether public or private) except if exempted pursuant to this Act, shall,
before embarking on the proposed project, apply in writing to the Agency, so that subject activities can be quickly
and surely identified and environmental assessment applied as the activities are being planned.  
3. Identification, etc., of significant environmental issues  
(1) In identifying the environmental impact assessment process under this Act, the relevant significant
environmental issues shall be identified and studied before commencing or embarking on any project or activity
convened by the provisions of this Act or covered by the Agency or likely to have serious environmental impact on
the Nigerian environment.  
(2) Where appropriate, all efforts shall be made to identify all environmental issues at an early stage in
the process.  
4. Minimum content of environmental impact assessment  
An environmental impact assessment shall include at least the following minimum matters, that is‐  
(a)   a description of the proposed activities;  
(b)   a description of the potential affected environment, including specific   
information necessary to identify and assess the environmental effect of the     proposed
activities;  
(c)   a description of the practical activities, as appropriate;  
(d)   an assessment of the likely or potential environmental impacts of the    
proposed activity and the alternatives, including the direct or indirect       cumulative,
short‐term and long‐term effects;  
(e)   an identification and description of measures available to mitigate adverse  
environmental impacts of proposed activity and assessment of those       measures;  
(f) an indication of gaps in knowledge and uncertainty which may be encountered    in
computing the required information;  
(g)   an indication of whether the environment of any other State or local    
government area or areas outside Nigeria is likely to be affected by the    
proposed activity or its   alternatives;  
(h)   a brief and non‐technical summary of the information provided under   
paragraphs (a) to `(g) of this section.  
5. Detailed degree of environmental significance  
The environmental effects in an environmental assessment shall be assessed with a degree of detailed
commensuration with their likely environmental significance.  
6. Examination of environmental impact assessment by the Agency  
The information provided as part of an environmental impact assessment shall be examined impartially by the
Agency prior to any decision to be made thereto (whether in favour or adverse thereto).  
7. Opportunity for comments by certain groups  
Before the Agency gives a decision on an activity to which an environmental assessment has been produced, the
Agency shall give opportunity to government agencies, members of the public, experts in any relevant discipline
and interested groups to make comment on the environmental impact assessment of the activity.  
8. Decision not to be given until the appropriate period has elapsed  
The Agency shall not give a decision as to whether a proposed activity should be authorised or undertaken until
the appropriate period has elapsed to consider comments pursuant to sections 7 and 17 of this Act.  
9. Decision on the effect of an environmental impact assessment to be in writing  
(1) The Agency's decision on any proposed activity subject to environmental impact assessment shall‐  
(a)   be in writing;  
(b)   state the reason therefor;  
(c)   include the provisions, if any, to prevent, reduce or instigate damage to the  
environment.  
(2) The report of the Agency shall be made available to any interested person or group.  
(3) If no interested person or group requests for the report, it shall be the duty of the Agency to publish its
decision in a manner by which members of the public or persons interested in the activity shall be notified.  
(4) The Council may determine an appropriate method in which the decision of the Agency shall be
published so as to reach interested persons or groups, in particular the originators or persons interested in the
activity subject of the decision.  
10. Supervision of the activity  
When the Council deems it fit and appropriate, a decision on an activity which has been the subject of an
environmental impact assessment, the activity and its effect on the environment or the provisions of section 9 of
this Act shall be subject to appropriate supervision.  
11. Notification to potentially affected States or local government area, etc.
(1) When information provided as part of an environmental impact assessment indicates that the
environment within another State in the Federation or a local government area is likely to be significantly affected
by a proposed activity, the State or the local government area in which the activity is being planned, shall, to the
extent possible‐  
(a)   notify the potentially affected State or local government of the proposed     activity;  
(b)   transmit to the affected State or local government area any relevant    
information of the environmental impact assessment;  
(c)   enter into timely consultations with the affected State or local government.  
(2) It shall be the duty of the Agency to see that the provisions of subsection (1) of this section are
complied with and the Agency may cause the consultations provided pursuant to subsection (1) of this section to
take place in order to investigate any environmental derogation or hazard that may occur during the construction
or process of the activity concerned.  
12. Mandatory study list not to be carried out without the report of the Agency  
(1) When a project is described on the mandatory study list specified in the Schedule to this Act or is
referred to mediation or a review panel, no Federal, State or local Government or any of their authority or agency
shall exercise any power or perform any duty or functions that would permit the project to be carried out in whole
or in part until the Agency has taken a cause of action conducive to its power under the Act establishing it, or has
taken a decision or issued an order that the project could be carried out with or without conditions.  
      [Schedule.]
(2) Where the Agency has given certain conditions before the carrying out of the project, the conditions
shall be fulfilled before any person or authority shall embark on the project.  
      PART II
    Environmental assessment of projects
13. Cases where environmental assessment is required  
Notwithstanding the provisions of Part I of this Act, an environmental impact assessment shall be required where a
Federal, State or local government agency authority established by the Federal, State or local government council‐  
(a)   is the proponent of the project and does any act or thing which commits the     Federal,
State or local government authority to carrying out the project in     whole or in part;  
(b)   makes or authorises payment or provides a guarantee for a loan or any other     form of
financial assistance to the proponent for the purpose of enabling the     project to be carried out
in whole or in part,
except when the financial assistance is in the form of any reduction, avoidance, deferral, removal, refund,
remission or other form of relief from the payment of any tax, duty or excise under the Customs Excise Tariff, etc.
(Consolidated) Act or any order made thereunder, unless that financial assistance is provided for the purpose of
enabling an individual project specifically named in the enactment, regulation or order that provides the relief to
be carried out;  
       [Cap. C49.]
(c)   has the administration of Federal, State or local government and leases or  
otherwise disposes of those lands or any tests in those lands or transfers the     administration
and control of those lands or invests therein in favour of the     Federal Government or its agencies for the
purpose of enabling the project to    be carried out in whole or in part; or  
(d)   under the provisions of any law or enactment, issues a permit or licence,     grants
an approval or takes any other action for the purpose of enabling the     project to be carried out in whole
or in part.  
14. Excluded projects  
(1) An environmental assessment of a project shall not be required where‐  
(a)   in the opinion of the Agency the project is in the list of projects which the  
President or the Council is of the opinion that the environmental effects of the    project are likely
to be minimal;  
(b)   the project is to be carried out during national emergency for which temporary  
measures have been taken by the Government;  
(c)   the project is to be carried out in response to circumstances that, in the opinion of the Agency,
the project is in the interest of public health or safety.  
(2) For greater certainty, where the Federal, State or local government exercises power or performs a duty or
function for the purpose of enabling projects to be carried out, an environmental assessment may not be required
if‐  
(a)   the project has been identified at the time the power is exercised or the duty     or
function is performed; and  
(b)   the Federal State, or local government has no power to exercise any duty or     perform
functions in relation to the projects after they have been identified.  
15. Environmental assessment process  
Whenever the Agency decides that there is the need for an environmental assessment on a project before the
commencement of the project, the environmental assessment process may include‐  
(a)   a screening or mandatory study and the preparation of a screening report;  
(b)   a mandatory study or assessment by a review panel as provided in section 35     of this
Act and the preparation of a report;  
(c)   the design and implementation of a follow‐up program.  
16. Factors for consideration of a review panel  
(1) Every screening or mandatory study of a project and every mediation or assessment by a review panel
shall include a consideration of the following factors, that is‐  
(a)   the environmental effects of the project, including the environmental effects     of
malfunctions or accidents that may occur in connection with the project and     any cumulative
environmental effects that are likely to result from the project     in taking into consideration with
other projects that have been or will be     carried out;  
(b)   the significance or, in the case of projects referred to in section 47,48 or 49,     the
seriousness of those effects;  
(c)   comments concerning those effects received from the public in accordance     with
provisions of this Act;  
(d)   measures that are technically and economically feasible and that would    
mitigate any significant or, in the case of projects referred to in sections 47, 48    or 49 any serious  
adverse environmental effects of the project.  
(2) In addition to the factors set out in subsection (1) of this Act, every mandatory study of a project and every
mediation or assessment by a review panel shall include a consideration of the following factors, that is‐  
(a)   the purpose of the project;  
(b)   alternative means of carrying out the project that are technically and    
economically feasible and the environmental effects of any such alternative     means;  
(c)   the need for and the requirements of any follow‐up programme in respect of     the
project;  
(d)   the short‐term or long‐term capacity for regeneration of renewal resources     that are
likely to be significantly or, in the case of the projects referred to in     sections 47, 48, or 49 of this Act,
seriously affected by the project; and  
     (e)   any other matter that he Agency or the Council at the request of the Agency,     may
require.  
(3) For greater certainty, the scope of the factors to be taken into consideration pursuant to subsection
(1) (a), (b) and (d) and subsection (2) (b), (c) and (d) of this section shall be determined‐  
(a)   by the Agency; or  
(b)   where a project is referred to mediation or a review panel, by the Council, after consulting the
Agency, when fixing the terms of reference of the mediation or review panel.  
(4) An environmental assessment of a project shall be required to include a consideration of the
environmental effect that could result from carrying out the project during the declaration of a national
emergency.  
17. Factors not included  
(1) The Agency may delegate any part of the screening or mandatory study of a project, including the
preparation of the screening report or mandatory study report, but shall not delegate the duty to take a course of
action pursuant to section 21 (1) or 39 (1) of this Act.  
(2) For greater certainty, the Agency shall not take a course of action pursuant to section 21 (1) or 39 (1)
unless it is satisfied that any duty or function delegated pursuant to subsection (1) thereof has been carried out in
accordance with the provisions of this Act or any relevant enactment.

exclusion list, the Agency shall ensure that‐  
(a)   a screening of the project is conducted; and  
(b)   a screening report is prepared.  
(2) Any available information may be used in conducting the screening of a project, but where the Agency
is of the opinion that the information available is not adequate to enable it to take a course of action pursuant to
section 21 (1) of this Act, it shall ensure that any study and information that it considers necessary for that purpose
are undertaken or collected.  
19. Declaration of class screening report  
(1) Where the Agency receives a screening report and the Agency is of the opinion that the report could
be used as a method in conducting screening of other projects within the same class, the Agency may declare the
report to be a class screening report.  
(2) Any declaration made pursuant to subsection (1) of this Act, shall be published in the Gazette and the
screening report to which it relates shall be made available to the public at the registry maintained by the Agency.  
(3) Where, in the opinion of the Agency, a project or part of a project is within a class in respect of which a
class screening report has been declared, the Agency may use or permit the use of that report and the screening
on which it is based to whatever extent the Agency considers appropriate for the purpose of complying with
section 12 of this Act.  
(4) Where the Agency uses or permits the use of a class screening report, it shall ensure that any
adjustments are made that in the opinion of Agency are necessary to take into account local circumstances and
any cumulative environmental effects that in the opinion of the Agency are likely to result from the project in
combination with other projects that have been or will be carried out.  
20. Use of previously conducted screening  
(1) Where a proponent proposes to carry out, in whole or in part, a project for which a screening report
has been prepared but the project did not proceed or the manner in which it is to be carried out has subsequently
changed or where a proponent seeks the renewal of a licence permit or approval referred to in section 5 (d) of this
Act in respect of a project for which a screening report has been prepared, the Agency may use or permit the use
of that report and the screening on which it is based to whatever extent the Agency considers appropriate for the
purpose of complying with section 12 of this Act.  
(2) Where the Agency uses or permits the use of a screening or screening report pursuant to subsection
(1) of this section, the Agency shall ensure that any adjustments are made that in its opinion are necessary to take
into account any significant changes in the circumstances of the project.  
21. Decision of the Agency  
(1) After completion of a screening report in respect of a project, the Agency shall take one of the
following courses of action, that is‐  
(a)   where, in the opinion of the Agency‐  
    (i) the project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects;     or  
    (ii) any such effect can be mitigated,  
the Agency may exercise any power or perform any duty or function that would permit the project to be carried
out and shall ensure that any mitigation measures that the Agency considers appropriate are implemented;  
(b)   where, in the opinion of the Agency‐  
    (i)   the project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects   
that may not be mitigable; or  
    (ii)   public concerns respecting the environmental effects of the project    
warrant it,  
the Agency shall refer the project to the Council for a referral to mediation or a review panel in accordance with
section 35 of this Act; or  
(c)   where, in the opinion of the Agency, the project is likely to cause significant     adverse
environmental effects that cannot be mitigated, the Agency shall not     exercise any power or perform any
duty or function conferred on it under any     enactment that would permit the project to be carried out in
whole or in part.  
(2) For greater certainty, where the Agency takes a course of action referred to in subsection (1) (a) of this
section, the Agency shall exercise any power and perform any duty or function conferred on it by or under any
enactment in a manner that ensures that any mitigation measures that the Agency considers appropriate in
respect of the project, are implemented.  
(3) Before taking a course of action in relation to a project pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the
Agency shall give the public an opportunity to examine and comment on the screening report and any record that
has been filed in the public registry established in respect of the project pursuant to section 51 of this Act and shall
take into consideration any comments that are filed.  
22. Mandatory study
Where the Agency is of the opinion that a project is described in the mandatory study list, the Agency shall‐  
(a)   ensure that a mandatory study is conducted, and a mandatory study report is  
prepared and submitted to the Agency, in accordance with the provisions of     this Act; or  
(b)   refer the project to the Council for a referral to mediation or a review panel in  
accordance with section 35 of this Act.  
23. Use of previously conducted mandatory study  
(1) Where a proponent proposes to carry out, in whole or in part, a project for which a mandatory study
report has been prepared but the project did not proceed or the manner in which it is to be carried out has
subsequently changed, or where a proponent seeks the renewal of a licence, permit or approval referred to in
section 5 (d) of this Act in respect of a project for which a mandatory study report has been prepared, the Agency
may use or permit the use of that report and the mandatory study on which it is based to whatever extent the
Agency considers appropriate for the purpose of complying with section 12 of this Act.  
(2) Where the Agency uses or permits the use of a mandatory study or a mandatory study report pursuant
to subsection (1) of this section, it shall ensure that any adjustments are made that in its opinion are necessary to
take into account any significant changes in the circumstances of the project.
