(Regulation 10)
1. Warehousing and Storage
(a) The pesticide and toxic substances warehouse should be located away from homes,
highly populated areas, drinking water sources and areas liable to flooding.
(b) The floors in the building should be of concrete with a load bearing capacity sufficient to
withstand the weight of the stock, ranking and any mechanical handling equipment to be
used. Floors should be impervious to liquids, free from cracks and smooth to facilitate
cleaning.
(c) The building should be designed such that escape in case of emergency should be
possible from any enclosed area in at least two directions. Emergency exits should be
clearly marked.
(d) The warehouse should have access from at least two sides to facilitate fire fighting,
regardless of wind directions and also facilitate easy escape from an enclosed area.
(e) All warehouses constructed above ground level should have special provision for
bunding. This can be achieved, for example by constructing ramps across external
doorways of existing warehouses.
(f) The building should permit reasonable movement of materials and enough space to allow
hygienic working conditions and clear access to fire-fighting equipment.
(g) The walls of the warehouse should be of non-flammable type and all pipings and electrical
wiring should be sealed.
(h) The roof of the warehouse should be able to effectively keep out rain, be able to provide
both ventilation to allow fumes and heat to escape in case of fire and at the same time
provide protection against direct sunlight.
(i) The warehouse should have drains which should not be directly linked to waterways or
public sewers. They should instead be linked by a closed system, to an evaporation tank.
(j) The evaporation tank should be emptied from time to time depending on the accumulation
of solid waste. It should be covered during the rainy season to avoid filling by rain water.
2. (a) All products should be stored under lock and key with proper warning signs displayed
clearly to keep away unauthorised persons. Pesticides and toxic substances must be
stored in a separate warehouse, away from any other goods especially foods and
stockfeeds.
(b) Before storing any pesticides ensure that they are properly labelled and are of good
quality and acceptable condition. If any of the products are not in good condition, do not
store them together with other products but take appropriate action.
(c) If pesticides and toxic substances are to be stacked inside the warehouse, stacking
heights should not exceed three metres unless the use of racking prevents overloading
of the lower tiers.
(d) Persons loading pesticides and toxic substances in the warehouse should pay special
attention to "THIS SIDE UP" signs on cartoned packs.
(e) Pesticides and toxic substances should be stored separately, preferably according to their
use in the field e.g. herbicides, insecticides etc. The objective of this is to prevent cross
contamination as well as minimise the risk of fire and consequent environmental
contamination often presented by mixed storage arrangements.
 3. (a) All stocks in the warehouse should be frequently inspected for leakages, caking of
powders, pulverisation of granules, sedimentation or gelling of liquids, change in colour
due to oxidation, dampness of packages and corrosion or deterioration of containers. All
leakages must be treated as being extremely toxic.
(b) Spillages should not be cleaned out with water. They must be swept up and kept in a
special labelled container awaiting safe disposal. Liquids should first be absorbed by saw
dust, earth or any other absorbent before being swept out.
(c) Every warehouse must have an emergency spills treatment kit consisting of a PVC
apron, neoprene gloves, a gas mask, a brush or broom, a dust pan, an empty clearly
labelled container (for collecting wastes) a container of sawdust and a spade.
(d) Always strictly follow the rule "First-in First-out" i.e. new stocks should be moved to the
rear.

Disposal Options
 Pesticides, toxic substances, wastes, those which are expired, spillage and left over diluted
product and packaging material can be disposed of in the following manner:
1. Product use by Recycling
 If an alternative use exists the product may be reused or may be reformulated for the purpose for
which it is intended to be used.
2.High Temperature Incineration (High Temperature Thermal Oxidation)
 Should be considered when disposing of most pesticides and toxic substances, but should NOT be
used when disposing-
(a) inorganic materials;
(b) organic products containing heavy metals such as mercury and lead;
3. Chemical Treatment
 To be used as a disposal technology for a few specific unformulated pesticides and some other
toxic substances. The products of decomposition from such treatment should not present toxic or
environmental hazard.
4. Long Term Storage
 Certain compounds cannot be disposed of safely using existing technology. Such compounds
include those containing heavy metals and in particular, organomercury compounds.
 The only available option is to contain and store these products safely until a suitably acceptable
disposal technology is developed.
 A full risk analysis should be made for all materials stored to ensure maximum safety over the
longest foreseeable period of time.
5. Landfill (for Incinerator Ash and SLG Only)
 Landfilling is not an acceptable disposal option for pesticides and toxic wastes which can be
leached. Incinerator ash and slag can be disposed of at approved landfill sites.
6. Waste Solidifications/Fixation
 The process involves the mixing of chemical and other waste with building materials such as
cement, silicates and plymers, causing the mixtures to solidify into an impervious mass. Waste
treated in this way can be disposed of at a landfill. This should be applicable to inorganic wastes.
Organic wastes could easily leach into ground water with time, and should therefore not be used in
disposing organic pesticides or toxic substances.
7. Packaging Materials Disposal
 Contaminated packaging material shall be disposed of as follows:
(a) Contaminated Packaging material-Cartons, boxes and bags should be cut and rendered
non-usable. The waste should be overpacked in plastic bags to minimise the risk for
exposure during handling:
(i) Burning in a simple incinerator, or on a hot fire in isolated area downwind of the
nearest habitation.
(ii) Burial in an approved landfill
(b) Small Packs
 Small packaging shall be drained well to reduce residues to a minimum by triple-rinsing with water
or an appropriate solvent such as diesel fuel. The triple rinsed packaging material should be made
unusable by shredding or crushing. Combustible packaging material should be incinerated.
 Non-combustible crushed containers should be buried in a landfill site.
 Small packs which cannot be or have not been triple rinsed should be over-packed in strong
polyethylene bags or preferably 200 litre steel drums for disposal as toxic wastes.
(c) Large containers
 Effort must be made to drain the maximum amount of residue from each container prior to triple
rinsing with water or suitable solvent and disposed of as follows:
 (i) Steel Drums
 Triple-rinsed and drained drums should be crushed, to render them unusable and disposed
of by either:
 -STEEL SMELTING-This is the preferred option. Where the drums are processed at high

10. Return to Manufacturer-Where a manufacturer is willing to accept pesticides or toxic substances
wastes or expired obsolete stocks, this will be accepted as a disposal option.

(2) The co-ordinator, the team and the Council determines which of the impacts shall be the
subject of the study based on the following criteria:
(a) magnitude, including the impact of the project on environmental resources;
(b) extent, including the geographical extent of the impact;
(c) significance, including the actual effects of the impacts on the environmental resource;
and
(d) special sensitivity, including impacts which are significant in the specific local economic,
social and ecological setting (see Regulation 8).
(3) The developer submits the names and qualifications of all persons to carry out the study to
the Council for approval.
STAGE 3: BASELINE STUDY
The team undertakes a detailed description of the existing environment including the social and
economic activities of the population resident in the potentially affected area.
STAGE 4: IMPACT EVALUATION
The team predicts and evaluates the various predicted impacts and ranks them in order of
importance on the basis of two criteria:
(1) Quantitative change where change can be quantified.
(2) Qualitative change where change cannot be quantified, but instead the impact of the
project depends on the environmental acceptability of the project.

STAGE 5: PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY
(1) The team seeks the view of the communities which are likely to be affected by the project.
(2) The views sought in (1) are considered in the development of mitigation measures
(regulation 11).
STAGE 6: IDENTIFICATION OF MITIGATION MEASURES
(1) The team identifies measures for the elimination (where possible), or reduction, of
environmental impact for the various alternatives identified in the study such as:
(a) engineering works in noise reduction, prior treatment of effluent air pollution reduction
measures and solid waste minimisation through reclamation, recycling and any other
appropriate measures.
(b) management measures especially in the areas of natural resources, reforestation, control
of soil erosion, desalinisation, desilting.
(2) The team includes the cost mitigation measures into the impact evaluation.
(3) Where necessary the team will create a new alternative based on the mitigation.
STAGE 7: ASSESSMENT (OR COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVES)
(1) The team compares all alternatives on the basis of economic, socio-cultural and
environmental gains and costs.
(2) The team ranks and recommends the various alternatives to the developer on the basis of
