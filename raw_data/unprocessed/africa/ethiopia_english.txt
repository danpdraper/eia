PART TWO
3. General Pro visions
1) Without authorization from the Authority or from
the relevant regional environmental agency, no
person shall commence implementation of any
project that requires environmental impact assessment as determined in a directive issued pursuant to
Article 5 of this Proclamation.
2) Without prejudice to Sub Article (1) of this Article,
when the Authority or the relevant regional environmental agency believes that the possible impacts of
the project are insignificant, it may decide not to
require the concerned proponetn to conduct an
environmental impact assessment.
3) Any licensing agency shall, prior to issuing an
investment permit or a trade or an operating license
for any project, ensure that the Authority or the
relevant regional environmental agency has
authorized its implementation.
4) Approval of an environmental impact study report or
the granting of authorization by the authority or the
relevant regional environmental agency does not
exonerate the proponent from liability for damage.
5) Without prejudice to Sub Article (4) of this Article,
exemption from liability shall be granted only when
it is verified that it is the victim himself or a third
party for whom the proponent is not responsible that
has caused the damage.
I 4. Considerations to Determine Zmvact
1) The impact of a project shall be assessed on the basis
of the size, location, nature, cumulative effect with
other concurrent impacts or phenomena, transregional effect, duration, reversibility or irreversibility or other related effects of the project.
2) The Authority or the relevant regional environmental agency shall err on the side of caution while
determining the negative impact of a project having
both beneficial and detrimental effects, but which,
on balance,is only slightly or arguably beneficial,
and thus determine that it is likely to entail a negative
significant impact.
5. Projects Requiring Environmental Impact Assessment
1) Every project which falls in any category listed in
any directive issued pursuant to this Proclamation
shall be subject to environmental impact assessment.
2) Any directive provided under Sub Article 1 of this
Article shall, , among other things, determine
categoris of:
(a) projects not likely to have negative impacts, and
so do not require environmental impact assessment;
(b) Projects likely to have negative impacts and
thus require environmental impact assessment.
6. Trans-Regional Impact Assessment
1) A proponent shall carry out the environmental
impact assessment of a project that is likely to
produce a trans-regional impact in consuitation with
the communities likely to be affected in any region.
