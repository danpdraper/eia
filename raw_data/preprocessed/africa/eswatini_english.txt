[7] After receipt of the strategic environmental assessment report the proponent shall review the legislation, policy, programme or plan taking into consideration the strategic environmental assessment report and shall submit the following documents to the Minister and to the Authority: [a] the strategic environmental assessment report; [b] a report indicating: [i] the revisions that have been made to the original document in order to promote environmental protection and the sustainable management of natural resources or to avoid, mitigate or remedy any adverse effects which implementation of the original legislation, policy, programme or plan, may have had; and [ii] any other measures that have been, or will be taken to avoid, mitigate or remedy any adverse effects, and when these were or will be taken, and if any measures recommended by the assessment report have or will not be taken, the reasons for not doing so; and [c] a revised version of the legislation, policy, programme or plan. [8] If the Authority is of the opinion that the environmental concerns raised during the strategic environmental assessment process are not adequately addressed by the revised legislation, or public policy, programme or plan, and that additional cost-effective measures to avoid or mitigate these adverse effects should be taken, the Authority, shall within 30 days of receipt of the documents referred to in subsection [7], lodge an objection with the proponent and then consult with the proponent with a view to reaching agreement on the amendments to be made to the revised legislation, or public policy, programme or plan in order to give full effect to the purpose and principles of this Act. [9] If the Authority and the proponent are unable to reach agreement on the amendments to be made to the revised legislation, or public policy, programme or plan or the measures to be taken, the Director or the proponent may lodge a notice of objection with the Minister. [10] The Minister may order the documents referred to in subsection [7] to be subjected to public review and/or to a public hearing before making a final determination under subsection [9].

Environmental Assessment
(32) [1] Subject to the provisions of regulations made under paragraphs [a], [b] or [c] of section 33, no person shall undertake any project that may have an effect on the environment without the written approval of the Authority, or in the case of a review, of the Minister, and except in accordance with any conditions imposed in that approval. [2] A person who contravenes subsection [1] commits an offence and shall, on conviction, be liable to imprisonment to a term not exceeding two years or a fine not exceeding one hundred thousand or to both. [3] No person, organ of Government or public body may grant a permit or licence for the execution of a project referred to in subsection [1] unless an approval for the project has first been granted by the Authority, or the grant of the permit of licence is made conditional upon such approval being granted. [4] A person proposing to undertake a project referred to in subsection [1] shall submit a project brief to the Authority containing sufficient information to enable the Authority to determine the potential impacts of the project on the environment. [5] If after reviewing the project brief the Authority is satisfied that: [a] the potential effect of the project on the environment is likely to be minimal or insignificant, it may approve the project; [b] the potential effect on the environment is likely to be more than minimal or insignificant, it may require the applicant: [i] to conduct an environmental impact assessment in relation to the project, with or without a public hearing; [ii] to submit to the Authority an environmental impact statement in accordance with subsection [7]; and [iii] to submit to the Authority a comprehensive mitigation plan in accordance with subsection [8]. [6] Subject to this Act, the Authority may delegate to another body or person any of its functions under this section and may impose conditions with respect to the exercise of those delegated functions, provided that nothing in this subsection shall be construed so as to absolve the Authority from ultimate responsibility for any act done by such a body or person in the exercise of this delegated authority. [7] An environmental impact statement shall include: [a] a full description of the project and the aim(s) it is intended to achieve; and [b] an identification, description and assessment of: [i] the likely environmental effects of: the project; alternative means of carrying out the project, including the preferred means; alternatives to the project that would achieve the same aim as the project was intended to achieve; and [ii] all relevant measures that could be undertaken to avoid, remedy or mitigate any adverse effects that could be caused by the project; [c] any other information prescribed by the Minister. [8] A comprehensive mitigation plan shall include: [a] a description of the mitigation measures that will be implemented in order to prevent, reduce or otherwise manage the environmental effects of a project; [b] how these measures will be implemented; and [c] any other information prescribed by the Minister. [9] If the Authority believes that a project is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the environment of another country the Authority shall advise the Minister who shall forward the environmental impact statement and comprehensive mitigation plan and other relevant reports and documents to that country and shall invite comments within a specified period. [10] If the Minister has invited comments under subsection [9] the Authority shall not decide whether or not to grant an approval until the period for comments has expired without any comments being received, or if comments are received, without considering those comments. [11] Upon receipt of the documents required under subsection [5][b], the Authority may: [a] if the application fails to contain the appropriate administration fee or fails to provide any information required under this section, refuse to consider the application and return the application to the applicant, together with written reasons for the refusal; [b] if the application does not provide adequate information required under this section, advise the applicant in writing of the reasons why it is inadequate and permit the applicant to revise the application, in which case the date of the revised application shall be considered as the date of application; [c] consider the application, and: [i] if it is determined that the project will significantly affect the public interest, require the matter to be subjected to public review and/or request the Minister to convene a public hearing in accordance with section 53; and [ii] if it is determined that the project will not significantly affect the public interest, determine whether to grant the approval and whether to impose any conditions in the approval. [12] If the Minister, acting on the advice of the Authority, considers that all the environmental concerns or effects are adequately addressed by the environmental impact assessment report and the accompanying comprehensive mitigation plan, the Minister shall grant an approval for a project subject to whatever terms and conditions the Minister considers appropriate to ensure that the adverse effects of the project are effectively avoided, mitigated and/or remedied. [13] The Minister shall refuse to grant an approval in respect of a project if the Authority considers that the implementation of the project would bring about unacceptable adverse effects or that the mitigation measures may be inadequate to satisfactorily mitigate the adverse effects of the proposed project. [14] Any person may within 60 days of the granting or refusal of an approval under this section, lodge an appeal in accordance with section 82 if that person: [a] has applied for an approval and the application has been refused; [b] objects to approval conditions imposed by the Minister; [c] objects to the granting of an approval; or [d] objects to a regulation deeming a project or class of projects to be likely, or not to be likely, to have an effect on the environment, or to significantly affect or not significantly affect the public interest. 

Regulations
(33) The Minister, on the advice of the Authority, may make regulations for the better administration of strategic environmental assessments and environmental impact assessments and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may by regulation prescribe: [a] categories of projects that are deemed to have an effect on the environment for the purposes of subsection 32[1]; [b] categories of projects that are deemed not to have an effect on the environment for the purposes of subsection 32[1] and are consequently exempt from the application of that subsection; [c] categories of projects that are deemed to have a significant effect on the public interest for the purposes of subsection 32[10]; [d] procedural requirements for public hearings; [e] the information to be included in a strategic environmental assessment report, an environmental impact assessment report and comprehensive mitigation plan; [f] administration fees for the costs of dealing with approval applications; [g] categories of facilities and activities in respect of which the Authority may require environmental audits to be conducted and may require the submission of report on those audits to the Authority; [h] the contents of an environmental audit report, which may include among other things: [i] a detailed description of any facility or activity; [ii] a detailed description of the environmental effects of a facility or activity; and [iii] plans to prevent and reduce the risk of adverse effects, and to remedy adverse effects, caused by a facility or activity; and [i] penalties if any person fails to comply with a plan under subparagraph [iii] of paragraph [h].

[2] Upon receiving a request in accordance with subsection [1], the organ of Government shall assess the request, and shall: [a] if the request is too vague or uncertain to enable identification of the information sought, or if that organ of Government is unaware of the existence of the information sought, notify in writing the person requesting the information that this is the case; or [b] provide an opportunity for the person to view or copy any available documents. [3] No information need be provided under this section if it is exempt from being made public under another section of this Act. [4] The organ of Government responding to the request may charge an administration fee that will cover: [a] the expenses of providing copies; and [b] the other administrative costs of dealing with the request, including labour costs, if more than one day was reasonably required to respond to the request.

[4] The responsible authority and the Authority shall not, if so requested by a person who made a written submission, disclose or make public personal or other information provided by that person.

Public Hearings
(53) [1] The responsible authority shall request the Minister to convene a public hearing if at least ten written and substantiated objections have been submitted during the public review process, and after considering all submissions the responsible authority is of the opinion that the high degree of public concern over the document, or the sensitive or significant nature of the matters referred to in the document, require that the public should have the opportunity to make submissions or comments at a public hearing. [2] The responsible authority shall within 60 days of the end of the public review period, decide whether or not to request the Minister to convene a public hearing and shall notify the Authority in writing giving reasons for its decision. [3] The Authority may, within 30 days of being notified that the responsible authority has decided not to request the Minister to convene a public hearing, apply to the Minister for a review of the decision of the responsible authority in accordance with section 82.

Public participation in licensing decisions
(55) [1] No licence may be issued or refused under this Act until four weeks after the day that a copy of the application for the licence was first placed on the registry. [2] Any person may comment on a licence application by lodging a notice of comment on the registry. [3] The Director shall consider any comments placed on the registry at least one week prior to issuance or refusal of the licence, and shall respond collectively to all comments other than frivolous or vexatious comments, by placing a notice of response on the registry no later than the day upon which the Director makes a decision on the application. [4] The Director shall, as soon as possible after deciding whether or not to grant a licence, notify each person who submitted a comment in respect of a licence application of the decision and of where further details may be obtained. [5] Any person may, within 10 days of the date on which the licence is issued or within 10 days of being notified of the decision under subsection [4], apply for the review of the decision or of any terms or conditions of the licence in accordance with section 82.

Orders initiated by the public
(56) [1] Any person may in writing request the Director to issue an order under this Act.

[4] If the Director decides not to issue an order the requesting person may within 10 days of the date of being notified of the decision under subsection [3], apply to the Minister for a review of the decision in accordance with section 82.

Prosecutions initiated by the public
(57) [1] Any person may in writing request the Director to investigate an alleged contravention of this Act. [2] The request shall set out reasons for the request, including the detailed factual grounds for believing that a contravention has occurred. [3] The Director shall consider the request and within one month shall decide whether to commence an investigation, and shall notify the requesting person in writing advising of that decision, the reasons for that decision, and, if applicable, the date upon which the Director intends to commence the investigation. [4] If the Director decides not to commence an investigation, the requesting person may lay a charge and initiate and conduct the prosecution and may obtain the assistance of any person in so doing. [5] Any person acting under subsection [4] shall in writing notify the Director prior to laying the charge. [6] No costs or damages shall be awarded against a person who initiates a prosecution after informing the Director in accordance with this section, unless the court finds that the primary motivation for the prosecution was not a concern for the public interest or for the enhancement, protection and conservation of the environment.

Civil Actions
(58) [1] Any person may sue for damages or for an interdict in respect of acts or omissions that constitute a contravention of this Act or that could cause an adverse effect, whether or not that person or any person has suffered or is likely to suffer, any loss or harm from the acts or omissions. [2] The right of action in subsection [1] is in addition to any other legal rights or remedies available to the plaintiff or applicant. [3] In any proceedings under subsection [1], the court shall order any damages awarded to be applied in the following order: [a] firstly, to compensate the plaintiff or applicant for any actual legal costs that are not fully compensated by a costs order against the defendant or respondent, and to compensate the plaintiff or applicant for any damages that person may have suffered; [b] secondly, to compensate other parties for any damages suffered and to remedy any adverse effect caused by the acts or omissions; and [c] thirdly, the balance if any shall be divided in equal parts between the Environment Fund, and the plaintiff. [4] No costs or damages shall be awarded against a person who initiates civil proceedings under subsection [1] unless the court finds that the primary motivation for the proceedings was not a concern for the public interest or the enhancement, protection or conservation of the environment.

Prevention Order
(63) [1] Where the Director has reasonable grounds to believe that a person is or will be conducting an activity, or is or will be in possession or control of a substance or thing that may result in an adverse effect, the Director may serve a prevention order on that person. [2] A prevention order may require that person: [a] to create a written emergency response plan that is adequate to reduce or eliminate the risk; [b] to provide a copy of that plan to the Director; [c] to have any necessary equipment, facilities and trained personnel available to deal with the risk; [d] upon an identified event or set of circumstances occurring, to implement the plan; and [e] to take whatever other measures may be necessary to ensure that any emergency can be effectively responded to.

[2] A protection order may require the person on whom it is served to take any measures that will assist in avoiding, remedying or mitigating the adverse effects and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to take any measures: [a] to stop the activity that is resulting or is likely to result in, an adverse effect; [b] to control the activity; [c] to assess the actual or anticipated extent of the adverse effect; [d] to remedy any adverse effects caused by the activity; and/or [e] to prevent a recurrence of the activity or the adverse effect.

Emergency Protection Order
(65) [1] Any Inspector who observes the discharge of a contaminant into the environment in an amount, concentration or manner that constitutes a risk to human health or property, or that causes or has the potential to cause adverse effects, may serve an emergency protection order on: [a] the owner, manager or person in control of the premises, vehicle, vessel, aircraft or equipment from which the discharge was or is being made; [b] any person who, at the time the discharge occurred, was the owner, manager or person in control of the premises, vehicle, vessel, aircraft or equipment from which the discharge was made; or [c] any person who caused or permitted the discharge.

(66) [1] Where the Director has reason to believe that any condition of a licence issued under this Act has been breached, the Director may serve a compliance order on the licence holder requiring that person to remedy the breach within a reasonable period stipulated in the order. [2] The compliance order may: [a] suspend the licence with immediate effect if the Director considers that this is necessary to prevent or mitigate an imminent risk of significant adverse effects to the environment or to human health occurring; and [b] require the licence holder to take specified measures to prevent or abate any adverse effect. [3] Where the licence holder fails to comply with the compliance order the Authority may: [a] take the necessary steps to remedy the breach and recover the cost from the licence holder in accordance with section 67; [b] alter the conditions of the licence; and/or [c] revoke the licence.

[2] Any person to whom a cost order has been issued may, within 20 days of the order being served, apply for a review of the order in accordance with section 82. [3] If no application for the review of a cost order is made within the period mentioned in subsection [2], the cost order may be enforced as if it were an order of court.

Offences
(68) It is an offence for any person: [a] intentionally to obstruct an inspector in the exercise or performance of powers or duties under this Act; [b] intentionally or negligently to make a statement that is false or misleading in a material particular, where the statement is made: [i] in response to a requirement to furnish information under this Act; or [ii] for the purpose of obtaining the granting or variation of a licence, permit or consent under this Act; [c] intentionally to make a false entry in any record or document required to be kept or completed under this Act; [d] falsely to pretend to be an inspector; [e] to contravene this Act or to breach the conditions of a licence, approval or order issued or made under this Act.

Liability of Managers of Bodies Corporate
(69) [1] Where a body corporate commits an offence under this Act, every director or partner and any other person concerned in the management of the body corporate commits the offence unless that person proves that: [a] the offence was committed without his or her consent or connivance; and [b] the person exercised all such diligence to prevent the commission of the offence as ought to have been exercised by that person having regard to the nature of his or her functions in that capacity and to all the circumstances. [2] Every director or partner and any other person concerned in the management of a body corporate to which a licence or order has been issued under this Act shall take all reasonable steps to prevent the body corporate from contravening or failing to comply with the licence or order. [3] A person who contravenes subsection [2] commits an offence and shall, on conviction, be liable to imprisonment to a term not exceeding one year or to a fine not exceeding 50,000 Emalangeni or to both. [4] Nothing in this section detracts from the liability or responsibility attached to any person under any other Act or law.

Defences
(70) [1] Except as otherwise specified in this Act, in any prosecution under this Act it is a defence for the person charged to prove that they took all reasonable precautions and exercised all such diligence to prevent the commission of the offence as ought to have been exercised by that person having regard to all the circumstances. [2] It is not a defence to a charge under this Act that the defendant was rendered unable to comply by an act or omission of the defendant that would have constituted a contravention of this Act.

Continuing offences and penalties
(71) [1] Except as otherwise specified in this Act or the regulations, every person who is convicted of an offence that is a continuing one, shall in addition to the penalty prescribed for the offence, be liable upon conviction to a further fine for each day or part of a day on which the offence continues, which: [a] in the case of an individual, shall not exceed Emalangeni 100 per day on a first conviction, and not more than Emalangeni 500 per day on each subsequent conviction; and [b] in the case of a legal person, shall not exceed Emalangeni 5,000 per day on a first conviction, and not more than Emalangeni 10,000 per day on each subsequent conviction. [2] Every natural person convicted of a contravention of section 34 or section 41[1] is liable upon conviction, for each day or part of a day on which the offence occurs or continues, to a fine of not exceeding Emalangeni 500 on a first conviction, and not less than Emalangeni 100, and not more than Emalangeni 20,000, or to a term of imprisonment of not more than 2 years, or to both, on each subsequent conviction. [3] Every body corporate convicted of a contravention of section 34 or section 41[1] is liable upon conviction, for each day or part of a day on which the offence occurs or continues, to a fine of not exceeding Emalangeni 10,000 on a first conviction, and not less than Emalangeni 1,000 and not exceeding Emalangeni 50,000, and to winding up, or to both, on each subsequent conviction. [4] A person who is found guilty of an offence under this Act for which no other penalty is provided shall, on conviction, be liable to imprisonment to a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding 5,000 Emalangeni or to both.

Deprivation of Monetary Benefits
(72) Any court that convicts a person of an offence under this Act shall summarily and without pleadings inquire into the monetary benefit acquired or saved by the person as a result of the commission of the offence, and may, in addition to any other penalty imposed, impose a fine in an amount equal to court's estimation of that monetary benefit, despite any maximum penalty elsewhere provided.

Costs of Investigations and Prosecution
(73) Upon the application of the prosecutor, any court that convicts a person of an offence under this Act shall summarily and without pleadings inquire into the costs of investigating and prosecuting the offence, and may in addition to any other penalty imposed, order the person convicted to pay an amount equal to that cost to the person(s) who incurred the costs, despite any maximum penalty elsewhere provided.

Suspension and Revocation of Licences
(74) Any court that convicts a person of an offence under this Act may suspend, revoke or amend any licence issued to that person under this Act.

Protection, repair and costs orders
(75) Any court that convicts a person of an offence under this Act may, in addition to any other penalty imposed: [a] order the person to take and pay for measures to avoid, remedy or mitigate any adverse effects arising from or likely to arise from the offence; and [b] if the person fails to comply with an order under paragraph [a], may issue an order allowing the Director to take those measures, and requiring the person to pay the Director's costs of so doing.

Fixed Penalties
(76) [1] The Minister may by regulation prescribe those offences against this Act in respect of which alleged offenders may pay a fine prescribed in the regulation instead of being tried by a court for the offence, provided that the maximum fine which may be prescribed for any one offence shall not exceed: [a] 100 Emalangeni if the alleged offender is required to pay the fine immediately in order to avoid prosecution; [b] 200 Emalangeni if the alleged offender is a natural person; or [c] 5,000 Emalangeni if the alleged offender is a legal person. [2] An inspector who has reason to believe that a person has committed an offence prescribed under subsection [1] may, at or about the time that the alleged offence is believed to have been committed, give an infringement notice to the alleged offender. [3] An infringement notice shall be in the prescribed form and shall in every case: [a] contain a description of the alleged offence; [b] state that if the alleged offender does not wish to be charged and tried by a court, the amount of money specified in the notice as being the modified penalty for the offence may be paid either: [i] to the authorised Public Officer identified in the notice within 28 days after the giving of the notice; or [ii] in the case of an offence in respect of which an on the spot fine is prescribed, to the Inspector. [4] An authorised Public Officer may, in a particular case, extend the period of 28 days for payment of the modified penalty and may do so whether or not that period has elapsed. [5] If the modified penalty specified in the infringement notice is paid within 28 days or such further time as is allowed and the notice is not withdrawn, the bringing of proceedings and the imposition of penalties are prevented to the same extent as they would be if the alleged offender had been convicted by a court of, and punished for, the alleged offences. [6] Any person who receives payment of a modified penalty, including an on the spot fine, shall give an official receipt for the money to the person who makes the payment. [7] The Director may, whether or not the modified penalty has been paid, withdraw the infringement notice by sending to the alleged offender a notice of withdrawal in the prescribed form. [8] If an infringement notice is withdrawn after payment of the modified penalty, the amount shall be refunded. [9] Payment of a modified penalty is not to be regarded as an admission for the purpose of any civil or criminal proceedings. [10] The Director may appoint any Public Officer other than an inspector to be an authorised person for the purposes of this section.

Presumptions
(77) [1] For the purposes of this Act, an adverse effect is deemed to have been caused by an act or omission if it is possible that the effect could have resulted from the act or omission, if it was reasonably foreseeable that the effect could have resulted from the act or omission, and if there was no other plausible cause for the effect. [2] For the purposes of this Act, any act or thing done or omitted to be done by a director, officer, employee or agent of a body corporate in the course of exercising their powers, functions or duties is deemed to be an act or thing done or omitted to be done by the body corporate.

Documentary Evidence
(78) In any proceedings under this Act or the regulations, an official document that purports to be signed by the Minister, the Director or an Environment Officer or Inspector shall be received in evidence as proof, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, of the facts stated in the document without proof of the signature or position of the person appearing to have signed the document.

Civil Damages
(79) [1] The Minister may, without prejudice to any other legal action, institute an action for damages caused to the environment. [2] In any such action, damages shall be payable to the Environment Fund. [3] Where damages cannot be quantified precisely, the competent civil court may liquidate such damages.

Financial Assurance
(80) [1] The Minister may make regulations: [a] defining and classifying guarantees, bonds, letters of credit and other types of financial assurance; [b] requiring from any person to whom a licence, order or approval is issued or has been issued the provision of financial assurance; [c] enabling the Authority or its delegate to use funds from financial assurance mechanisms to carry out actions specified in any licence or order, and to take such steps as are necessary to carry out those actions, and defining the circumstance in which the Authority may do so; [d] regulating the holding, transfer, reduction and release of financial assurance; [e] prescribing penalties and allowing the revocation of licences for the failure to provide financial assurance when required; and [f] otherwise allowing for and regulating the use of financial assurance for the purpose of protecting the environment. 

PART X - REVIEWS AND APPEALS

Right of Review
(81) [1] Any person who is aggrieved by any decision made, or direction given, by the Authority taken in the exercise of its powers and functions under this Act, may apply in accordance with section 82 for a review of that decision or direction by delivering a review application to the Director. [2] Without prejudice to any other grounds for review, any person may object to the granting of licence, permit or other authorisation under this Act on the basis that the conditions in the licence, permit or authorisation do not provide adequate protection to the environment or to human beings against the risk of adverse effects, or otherwise fail to give effect to the purpose of this Act.

Applying for a Review
(82) [1] A review application shall be accompanied by payment of any review fee prescribed by regulation and shall be delivered to the Director within the period specified in the relevant section, or if no period is specified, within 30 days after the date on which the applicant was given notice of the decision or direction that the applicant wants reviewed. [2] The Board has a discretion to accept a review application delivered out of time if it considers it is equitable to do so. [3] A review application shall: [a] state the name and address of the applicant; [b] set out or otherwise identify sufficiently the decision or direction that is to be reviewed; and [c] set out the grounds for the review and state briefly the facts on which the applicant relies. [4] On receiving a review application, the Director may reconsider the matter and may make a new decision. [5] If the Director does not consider it appropriate to change the original decision or if the Director makes a new decision that is not acceptable to the applicant, the Director shall immediately forward the application to the Board. [6] On receiving a review application the Board shall cause an inquiry to be conducted concerning the matters raised in the review application by a person or persons appointed by the Board in writing for that purpose. [7] Despite subsection [4], the Board may dismiss a review application and need not cause an inquiry to be conducted if the Board, after considering the review application, considers it to be trivial, frivolous or manifestly without merit. [8] The Board shall notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for dismissing a review application and the applicant may appeal against the decision to any competent court.

Staying of Orders
(83) [1] If an application has been made for the review of a direction in an order issued under this Act, the applicant may at any time prior to the determination of the review, under section 82, apply to the Board, or to the person appointed under section 82[6], for a temporary stay of the order. [2] The Board or person conducting the inquiry may, upon providing the applicant and the Director an opportunity to make oral or written submissions, decide to stay the order, to stay certain provisions of the order, or to dismiss the application for a stay.

Conduct of Inquiry
(84) [1] The applicant and the person who made the decision or gave the direction shall be given a reasonable opportunity of being heard by, and making written submissions to, the person conducting the inquiry. [2] An inquiry shall be conducted fairly according to the substantial merits of the case without regard to technicalities. [3] A person conducting an inquiry under this Act has the power to summon and examine witnesses on oath as if that person were a Commissioner as defined in the Commissions of Enquiry Act, No. 35 of 1963 and the provisions of sections 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 of that Act shall apply with the necessary modifications. [4] A person conducting an inquiry is not bound by any rules of evidence and may conduct the inquiry and obtain information as that person considers appropriate. [5] On completing the inquiry, the person conducting it shall report to the Board giving that person's findings and recommendations. [6] Where the person conducting an inquiry considers that it is desirable and necessary to do so, the person may, either on that person's own initiative or in response to an application by the applicant or by the person who made the decision or gave the direction being reviewed, refer a question of law arising in the inquiry for determination in the High Court. [7] If a question of law is referred to the High Court, the inquiry shall not be concluded until the judgement of the Court has been made and taken into account.

Review by the Board

PART XI - GENERAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS

Repeal and Amendment of Laws
(86) [1] The Swaziland Environment Authority Act, 1992 is repealed. [2] Notwithstanding subsection [1], regulations that are made pursuant to the Act referred to in that paragraph remain in force unless amended or revoked by another regulation or Act, and the rights and obligations of the Swaziland Environment Authority established under the Swaziland Environment Authority Act, 1992 are deemed to be the rights and obligations of the Authority. [3] Notwithstanding subsection [1], licences and permits issued under, and other rights, privileges, duties, obligations and liabilities acquired pursuant to, the Act referred to in that subsection, remain in force unless specifically abrogated, rescinded, revoked, repealed, suspended or otherwise changed pursuant to another Act, regulation or legal rule; but shall have no effect on the rights, privileges, duties, obligations and liabilities created in this Act, except as specified in this Act.

Immunity
(87) A person shall not be held liable in any civil, criminal or other proceedings in respect of any act done or not done in good faith in the exercise or purported exercise of functions under this Act.

Codes of Practice
(88) [1] The Minister may, by notice in the Gazette, issue codes of practice for the purposes of this Act and may amend or revoke them in the same manner. [2] A code issued under this section: [a] may incorporate by reference any other relevant document, either as it is in force at the time the code is issued or as it may be subsequently amended; [b] may provide that in any criminal proceedings relating to an alleged contravention of a provision of this Act, proof of compliance with the relevant provisions of the code shall constitute a defence. [3] The Minister shall not issue, amend or revoke a code of practice except on the recommendation of the Director after the Director has consulted with those persons and bodies whom the Director believes will be affected by the proposed code of practice, and in the case of a new or amended code, unless the new or amended code has been subjected to public review in accordance with section 52. [4] A failure on the part of any person to follow any guidance contained in a code issued under this section shall not of itself render that person liable to proceedings of any kind. [5] If it is alleged in a proceeding that a person has contravened a provision of this Act in relation to which a code of practice was in effect at the time of the alleged contravention, the code of practice is admissible in evidence in those proceedings and proof that the person complied with the relevant provision of the code may be relied on by the defence as tending to establish the person's innocence and conversely, proof that the person failed to comply with the relevant provision of the code may be relied on by the prosecution as tending to establish the person's guilt. [6] The Minister shall cause any code issued or revised under this section to be printed and distributed, including making copies of it available for sale to the public and available for inspection at the Registry.

Regulations
(89) [1] The Minister may make regulations to better administer this Act and to facilitate the achievement of the purpose of this Act, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing may make regulations: [a] relating to animal welfare and the prevention of cruelty to animals; [b] in respect of matters which are incidental or supplementary to any matter in respect of which the Minister is expressly authorised to make regulations under this Act; [c] prescribing fees or charges payable in respect of any matter arising under, provided for, or authorised by, this Act; [d] prescribing offences against regulations made under this Act and prescribing fines not exceeding 10,000 Emalangeni in respect of any one offence; [e] prescribing the forms of contents of applications, licences, approvals, consents, registers, notices, orders and other documents required for the purpose of this Act, or authorising the Director to prescribe such forms; [f] prescribing requirements as to information to be given in or in connection with returns, applications and other documents delivered or made for the purposes of this Act, and the evidence to be supplied in support; [g] regulating the authentication of any certificate, notice or other document issued under this Act; [h] requiring that any information or document required to be submitted under this Act be verified by statutory declaration; [i] providing the procedures for the service of notices, orders and documents under this Act and the times at which they shall be taken to have been served; and [j] prescribing the procedures to be followed for objections, reviews and appeals under this Act, and the making, consideration, hearing and determination of objections, reviews and appeals. [2] In order to achieve the purpose of this Act, the Minister may make any regulations under this Act in the absence of absolute or conclusive scientific proof in respect of adverse effect or risk, provided that the regulation mentions the precautionary principle as the rationale for so doing.

Supremacy of the Act
(90) Where there is an inconsistency between the provisions of this Act and any other law that affects the environment, other than the Constitution, this Act shall prevail.
