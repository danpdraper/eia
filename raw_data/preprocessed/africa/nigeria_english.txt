PART I - General principles of environmental impact assessment 

Goals and objectives of environmental impact assessment
(1) The objectives of any environmental impact assessment (in the Act referred to as "the assessment") shall be: [a] to establish, before a decision is taken by any person, authority, corporate body or unincorporated body, including the Government of the Federation, State or local government intending to undertake or authorise the undertaking of any activity, those matters that may likely or to a significant extent affect the environment or have an environmental effect on those activities and which shall first be taken into account; [b] to promote the implementation of appropriate policy in all Federal Lands (however acquired) States and local government areas, consistent with all laws and decision‐making processes through which the goal and objective in paragraph [a] of this section may be realised; [c] to encourage the development of procedures for information exchange, notification and consultation between organs and persons when proposed activities are likely to have significant environmental effects on boundary or trans‐State or on the environment of bordering towns and villages.

Restriction on public or private project without prior consideration of the environmental impact 
(2) [1] The public or private sector of the economy shall not undertake or embark on or authorise projects or activities without prior consideration, at an early stage, of their environmental effects. [2] Where the extent, nature or location of a proposed project or activity is such that it is likely to significantly affect the environment, its environmental impact assessment shall be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of this Act. [3] The criterion and procedure under this Act shall be used to determine whether an activity is likely to significantly affect the environment and is therefore subject to an environmental impact assessment. [4] All agencies, institutions (whether public or private) except if exempted pursuant to this Act, shall, before embarking on the proposed project, apply in writing to the Agency, so that subject activities can be quickly and surely identified and environmental assessment applied as the activities are being planned.

Identification, etc., of significant environmental issues 
(3) [1] In identifying the environmental impact assessment process under this Act, the relevant significant environmental issues shall be identified and studied before commencing or embarking on any project or activity convened by the provisions of this Act or covered by the Agency or likely to have serious environmental impact on the Nigerian environment. [2] Where appropriate, all efforts shall be made to identify all environmental issues at an early stage in the process.

Minimum content of environmental impact assessment 
(4) An environmental impact assessment shall include at least the following minimum matters, that is: [a] a description of the proposed activities; [b] a description of the potential affected environment, including specific information necessary to identify and assess the environmental effect of the proposed activities; [c] a description of the practical activities, as appropriate; [d] an assessment of the likely or potential environmental impacts of the proposed activity and the alternatives, including the direct or indirect cumulative, short‐term and long‐term effects; [e] an identification and description of measures available to mitigate adverse environmental impacts of the proposed activity and assessment of those measures; [f] an indication of gaps in knowledge and uncertainty which may be encountered in computing the required information; [g] an indication of whether the environment of any other State or local government area or areas outside Nigeria is likely to be affected by the proposed activity or its alternatives; [h] a brief and non‐technical summary of the information provided under paragraphs [a] to [g] of this section.

Detailed degree of environmental significance 
(5) The environmental effects in an environmental assessment shall be assessed with a degree of detail commensurate with their likely environmental significance.

Examination of environmental impact assessment by the Agency 
(6) The information provided as part of an environmental impact assessment shall be examined impartially by the Agency prior to any decision to be made thereto (whether in favour or adverse thereto).

Opportunity for comments by certain groups 
(7) Before the Agency gives a decision on an activity to which an environmental assessment has been produced, the Agency shall give opportunity to government agencies, members of the public, experts in any relevant discipline and interested groups to make comment on the environmental impact assessment of the activity.

Decision not to be given until the appropriate period has elapsed 
(8) The Agency shall not give a decision as to whether a proposed activity should be authorised or undertaken until the appropriate period has elapsed to consider comments pursuant to sections 7 and 17 of this Act.

Decision on the effect of an environmental impact assessment to be in writing 
(9) [1] The Agency's decision on any proposed activity subject to environmental impact assessment shall: [a] be in writing; [b] state the reason therefor; [c] include the provisions, if any, to prevent, reduce or instigate damage to the environment. [2] The report of the Agency shall be made available to any interested person or group. [3] If no interested person or group requests for the report, it shall be the duty of the Agency to publish its decision in a manner by which members of the public or persons interested in the activity shall be notified. [4] The Council may determine an appropriate method in which the decision of the Agency shall be published so as to reach interested persons or groups, in particular the originators or persons interested in the activity subject of the decision.

Supervision of the activity 
(10) When the Council deems it fit and appropriate, a decision on an activity which has been the subject of an environmental impact assessment, the activity and its effect on the environment or the provisions of section 9 of this Act shall be subject to appropriate supervision.

Notification to potentially affected States or local government area, etc.
(11) [1] When information provided as part of an environmental impact assessment indicates that the environment within another State in the Federation or a local government area is likely to be significantly affected by a proposed activity, the State or the local government area in which the activity is being planned, shall, to the extent possible: [a] notify the potentially affected State or local government of the proposed activity; [b] transmit to the affected State or local government area any relevant information of the environmental impact assessment; [c] enter into timely consultations with the affected State or local government. [2] It shall be the duty of the Agency to see that the provisions of subsection [1] of this section are complied with and the Agency may cause the consultations provided pursuant to subsection [1] of this section to take place in order to investigate any environmental derogation or hazard that may occur during the construction or process of the activity concerned.

Mandatory study list not to be carried out without the report of the Agency 
(12) [1] When a project is described on the mandatory study list specified in the Schedule to this Act or is referred to mediation or a review panel, no Federal, State or local Government or any of their authority or agency shall exercise any power or perform any duty or functions that would permit the project to be carried out in whole or in part until the Agency has taken a cause of action conducive to its power under the Act establishing it, or has taken a decision or issued an order that the project could be carried out with or without conditions. [2] Where the Agency has given certain conditions before the carrying out of the project, the conditions shall be fulfilled before any person or authority shall embark on the project. 

PART II - Environmental assessment of projects 

Cases where environmental assessment is required 
(13) Notwithstanding the provisions of Part I of this Act, an environmental impact assessment shall be required where a Federal, State or local government agency authority established by the Federal, State or local government council: [a] is the proponent of the project and does any act or thing which commits the Federal, State or local government authority to carrying out the project in whole or in part; [b] makes or authorises payment or provides a guarantee for a loan or any other form of financial assistance to the proponent for the purpose of enabling the project to be carried out in whole or in part, except when the financial assistance is in the form of any reduction, avoidance, deferral, removal, refund, remission or other form of relief from the payment of any tax, duty or excise under the Customs Excise Tariff, etc. (Consolidated) Act or any order made thereunder, unless that financial assistance is provided for the purpose of enabling an individual project specifically named in the enactment, regulation or order that provides the relief to be carried out; [c] has the administration of Federal, State or local government and leases or otherwise disposes of those lands or any tests in those lands or transfers the administration and control of those lands or invests therein in favour of the Federal Government or its agencies for the purpose of enabling the project to be carried out in whole or in part; or [d] under the provisions of any law or enactment, issues a permit or licence, grants an approval or takes any other action for the purpose of enabling the project to be carried out in whole or in part.

Excluded projects 
(14) [1] An environmental assessment of a project shall not be required where: [a] in the opinion of the Agency the project is in the list of projects which the President or the Council is of the opinion that the environmental effects of the project are likely to be minimal; [b] the project is to be carried out during national emergency for which temporary measures have been taken by the Government; [c] the project is to be carried out in response to circumstances that, in the opinion of the Agency, the project is in the interest of public health or safety. [2] For greater certainty, where the Federal, State or local government exercises power or performs a duty or function for the purpose of enabling projects to be carried out, an environmental assessment may not be required if: [a] the project has been identified at the time the power is exercised or the duty or function is performed; and [b] the Federal State, or local government has no power to exercise any duty or perform functions in relation to the projects after they have been identified.

Environmental assessment process 
(15) Whenever the Agency decides that there is the need for an environmental assessment on a project before the commencement of the project, the environmental assessment process may include: [a] a screening or mandatory study and the preparation of a screening report; [b] a mandatory study or assessment by a review panel as provided in section 35 of this Act and the preparation of a report; [c] the design and implementation of a follow‐up program.

Factors for consideration of a review panel 
(16) [1] Every screening or mandatory study of a project and every mediation or assessment by a review panel shall include a consideration of the following factors, that is: [a] the environmental effects of the project, including the environmental effects of malfunctions or accidents that may occur in connection with the project and any cumulative environmental effects that are likely to result from the project in taking into consideration with other projects that have been or will be carried out; [b] the significance or, in the case of projects referred to in section 47, 48 or 49, the seriousness of those effects; [c] comments concerning those effects received from the public in accordance with provisions of this Act; [d] measures that are technically and economically feasible and that would mitigate any significant or, in the case of projects referred to in sections 47, 48 or 49, any serious adverse environmental effects of the project. [2] In addition to the factors set out in subsection [1] of this section, every mandatory study of a project and every mediation or assessment by a review panel shall include a consideration of the following factors, that is: [a] the purpose of the project; [b] alternative means of carrying out the project that are technically and economically feasible and the environmental effects of any such alternative means; [c] the need for and the requirements of any follow‐up programme in respect of the project; [d] the short‐term or long‐term capacity for regeneration of renewable resources that are likely to be significantly or, in the case of the projects referred to in sections 47, 48, or 49 of this Act, seriously affected by the project; and [e] any other matter that the Agency or the Council at the request of the Agency, may require. [3] For greater certainty, the scope of the factors to be taken into consideration pursuant to subsection [1][a], [b] and [d] and subsection [2][b], [c] and [d] of this section shall be determined: [a] by the Agency; or [b] where a project is referred to mediation or a review panel, by the Council, after consulting the Agency, when fixing the terms of reference of the mediation or review panel. [4] An environmental assessment of a project shall be required to include a consideration of the environmental effect that could result from carrying out the project during the declaration of a national emergency.

Factors not included 
(17) [1] The Agency may delegate any part of the screening or mandatory study of a project, including the preparation of the screening report or mandatory study report, but shall not delegate the duty to take a course of action pursuant to section 21[1] or 39[1] of this Act. [2] For greater certainty, the Agency shall not take a course of action pursuant to section 21[1] or 39[1] unless it is satisfied that any duty or function delegated pursuant to subsection [1] thereof has been carried out in accordance with the provisions of this Act or any relevant enactment.

Screening 
(18) [1] Where the Agency is of the opinion that a project is not described in the mandatory study list or any exclusion list, the Agency shall ensure that: [a] a screening of the project is conducted; and [b] a screening report is prepared. [2] Any available information may be used in conducting the screening of a project, but where the Agency is of the opinion that the information available is not adequate to enable it to take a course of action pursuant to section 21[1] of this Act, it shall ensure that any study and information that it considers necessary for that purpose are undertaken or collected.

Declaration of class screening report 
(19) [1] Where the Agency receives a screening report and the Agency is of the opinion that the report could be used as a method in conducting screening of other projects within the same class, the Agency may declare the report to be a class screening report. [2] Any declaration made pursuant to subsection [1] of this section, shall be published in the Gazette and the screening report to which it relates shall be made available to the public at the registry maintained by the Agency. [3] Where, in the opinion of the Agency, a project or part of a project is within a class in respect of which a class screening report has been declared, the Agency may use or permit the use of that report and the screening on which it is based to whatever extent the Agency considers appropriate for the purpose of complying with section 12 of this Act. [4] Where the Agency uses or permits the use of a class screening report, it shall ensure that any adjustments are made that in the opinion of Agency are necessary to take into account local circumstances and any cumulative environmental effects that in the opinion of the Agency are likely to result from the project in combination with other projects that have been or will be carried out.

Use of previously conducted screening 
(20) [1] Where a proponent proposes to carry out, in whole or in part, a project for which a screening report has been prepared but the project did not proceed or the manner in which it is to be carried out has subsequently changed or where a proponent seeks the renewal of a licence permit or approval referred to in section 5[d] of this Act in respect of a project for which a screening report has been prepared, the Agency may use or permit the use of that report and the screening on which it is based to whatever extent the Agency considers appropriate for the purpose of complying with section 12 of this Act. [2] Where the Agency uses or permits the use of a screening or screening report pursuant to subsection [1] of this section, the Agency shall ensure that any adjustments are made that in its opinion are necessary to take into account any significant changes in the circumstances of the project.

Decision of the Agency 
(21) [1] After completion of a screening report in respect of a project, the Agency shall take one of the following courses of action, that is: [a] where, in the opinion of the Agency: [i] the project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects; or [ii] any such effect can be mitigated, the Agency may exercise any power or perform any duty or function that would permit the project to be carried out and shall ensure that any mitigation measures that the Agency considers appropriate are implemented; [b] where, in the opinion of the Agency: [i] the project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects that may not be mitigable; or [ii] public concerns respecting the environmental effects of the project warrant it, the Agency shall refer the project to the Council for a referral to mediation or a review panel in accordance with section 35 of this Act; or [c] where, in the opinion of the Agency, the project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects that cannot be mitigated, the Agency shall not exercise any power or perform any duty or function conferred on it under any enactment that would permit the project to be carried out in whole or in part. [2] For greater certainty, where the Agency takes a course of action referred to in subsection [1][a] of this section, the Agency shall exercise any power and perform any duty or function conferred on it by or under any enactment in a manner that ensures that any mitigation measures that the Agency considers appropriate in respect of the project, are implemented. [3] Before taking a course of action in relation to a project pursuant to subsection [1] of this section, the Agency shall give the public an opportunity to examine and comment on the screening report and any record that has been filed in the public registry established in respect of the project pursuant to section 51 of this Act and shall take into consideration any comments that are filed.

Mandatory study
(22) Where the Agency is of the opinion that a project is described in the mandatory study list, the Agency shall: [a] ensure that a mandatory study is conducted, and a mandatory study report is prepared and submitted to the Agency, in accordance with the provisions of this Act; or [b] refer the project to the Council for a referral to mediation or a review panel in accordance with section 35 of this Act.

Use of previously conducted mandatory study 
(23) [1] Where a proponent proposes to carry out, in whole or in part, a project for which a mandatory study report has been prepared but the project did not proceed or the manner in which it is to be carried out has subsequently changed, or where a proponent seeks the renewal of a licence, permit or approval referred to in section 5[d] of this Act in respect of a project for which a mandatory study report has been prepared, the Agency may use or permit the use of that report and the mandatory study on which it is based to whatever extent the Agency considers appropriate for the purpose of complying with section 12 of this Act. [2] Where the Agency uses or permits the use of a mandatory study or a mandatory study report pursuant to subsection [1] of this section, it shall ensure that any adjustments are made that in its opinion are necessary to take into account any significant changes in the circumstances of the project.

Public notice 
(24) [1] After receiving a mandatory study report in respect of a project, the Agency shall, in any manner it considers appropriate, publish in a notice setting out the following information: [a] the date on which the mandatory study report shall be available to the public; [b] the place at which copies of the report may be obtained; and [c] the deadline and address for filing comments on the conclusions and recommendations of the report. [2] Prior to the deadline set out in the notice published by the Agency, any person may file comments with the Agency relating to the conclusions and recommendations of the mandatory study report.

Decision of Council 
(25) After taking into consideration the mandatory study report and any comments filed pursuant to section 24[2], the Council shall: [a] refer the project to mediation or a review panel in accordance with section 35 of this Act where, in the opinion of the Council: [i] the project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects that may not be mitigable; or [ii] public concerns respecting the environmental effects of the project warrant it; or [b] refer the project back to the Agency for action to be taken under section 39[1][a] of this Act where, in the opinion of the Council: [i] the project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects; or [ii] any such effects can be mitigated.

Substitute for review panel 
(44) [1] Where the referral of a project to a review panel is required or permitted by this Act and the Council is of the opinion that a process for assessing the environmental effects of projects that is followed by a Federal authority under an Act of the National Assembly other than this Act, or by a body referred to in section 42[1][d] of this Act, would be an appropriate substitute, the Council may approve the substitution of that process for an environmental assessment by a review panel under this Act. [2] An approval of the Council pursuant to subsection [1] of this section shall be in writing and may be given in respect of a project or a class of projects.

Conditions 
(45) The Council shall not approve a substitution pursuant to subsection 44[1] of this Act unless the Council is satisfied that: [a] the process to be substituted includes a consideration of the factors referred to in section 11 of this Act; [b] the public has been given an opportunity to participate in the assessment; [c] at the end of the assessment, a report has been submitted to the Council; and [d] the report has been published.

Substitution 
(46) Where the Council approves a substitution of a process pursuant to section 44[1] of this Act, an assessment that is conducted in accordance with that process shall be deemed to satisfy any requirements of this Act, in respect of assessment by a panel.

Inter‐State environmental effects 
(47) [1] Where a project for which an environmental assessment is not required under section 5 of this Act, is to be carried out in a State and the President is of the opinion that the project is likely to have serious environmental effects in another State, the Council may establish a review panel, to conduct an assessment of the inter‐State environmental effects of the project. [2] The Council shall not establish a review panel pursuant to subsection [1] of this section where the President and the governments of all the interested States have agreed on another panel for conducting an assessment of the inter‐State environmental effects of the project. [3] A review panel may be established pursuant to subsection [1] of this section on the initiative of the President or at the request of the government of any interested State. [4] At least ten days before establishing a review panel pursuant to subsection [1] of this section, the President shall give notice of the intention to establish a panel to the proponent of the project and to the State or all interested States. [5] For the purposes of this section and section 49[3] of this Act, "interested state" means: [a] a State in which the project is to be carried out; or [b] a State that claims that serious adverse environmental effects are likely to occur in that State as a result of the project.

International environmental effects 
(48) [1] Where a project, for which an environmental assessment is not required under section 5 of this Act, is to be carried out in Nigeria or on Federal lands and the President is of the opinion that the project is likely to cause serious adverse environmental effects outside Nigeria and those Federal lands, the Agency and the Minister for Foreign Affairs may establish a review panel to conduct an assessment of the international environmental effects of the project. [2] At least ten days before establishing a review panel pursuant to subsection [1] of this section, the Agency, with the approval of the President, shall give notice of the intention to establish a panel to: [a] the proponent of the project; [b] the government of any State in which the project is to be carried out or that is adjacent to Federal lands on which the project is to be carried out; and [c] the government of any foreign State in which, in the opinion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, serious adverse environmental effects are likely to occur as a result of the project.

Environmental effects on Federal and other lands 
(49) [1] Where a project, for which an environmental assessment is not required under section 15 of this Act, is to be carried out in Nigeria and the Agency or the President is of the opinion that the project is likely to cause serious adverse environmental effects on Federal lands or on lands in respect of which a State or local government has interests, the Agency or the President may establish a review panel to conduct an assessment of the environmental effect of the project on those lands. [2] Where a project for which an environmental assessment is not required under section 5 of this Act, is to be carried out on lands in a local government land or on lands that have been set aside for the use and benefit of certain class of persons pursuant to legislation and the Agency is of the opinion that the project is likely to cause serious adverse environmental effects outside those lands, the Agency may establish a review panel to conduct an assessment of the environmental effects of the project outside those lands.
