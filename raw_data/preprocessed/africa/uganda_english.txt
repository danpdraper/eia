[2] The object of an environmental easement is to further the principles of environment management set out in section 3 by facilitating the conservation and enhancement of the environment, in this Statute referred to as the benefitted environment, through the imposition of one or more obligations in respect of the use of land, in this Statute referred to as the burdened land, being land in the vicinity of the benefitted environment. [3] An environmental easement may be imposed on and shall thereafter attach to the burdened land in perpetuity or for a term of years or for an equivalent interest under customary law as the court may determine.

[6] An environmental easement may exist in gross; that is to say, the validity and enforceability of the easement shall not be dependent on the existence of a plot of land in the vicinity of the burdened land which can be benefitted or, of a person with an interest in that plot of land who can be benefitted by the environmental easement.

Application for environmental easement.
(74) [1] A person or a group of persons may make an application to the court for the grant of an environmental easement.

[3] The procedures to enforce an environmental easement shall be: [a] in the case of proceedings for the grant of an environmental restoration order, the procedures set out in sections 71 and 72; [b] in the case of proceedings for a remedy available under the law relating to easements, the procedures applicable to such proceedings. [4] The court shall have a discretion to adapt and adjust, so far as seems necessary to it, the law and procedures relating to the enforcement of easements to the requirements of the enforcement of an environmental easement.

Registration of environmental easement.
(76) [1] Where an environmental easement is imposed on land, the title of which is registered under the Registration of Titles Act, the environmental easement shall be registered in accordance with the provisions of that Act applicable to the registration of easements. [2] Where an environmental easement is imposed on any land other than land referred to in subsection [1], the District Environment Committee of the area in which that land is situated shall register the environmental easement in a local register established for the purpose. [3] In addition to any matter which may be required by any law relating to the registration of easements to be included in the registration, the registration of an environmental easement shall include the name of the applicant for the environmental easement as the person in whose name the environmental easement is registered. 

Compensation for environmental easement. 
(77) [1] Any person who has a legal interest in the land which is the subject of an environmental easement, shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Statute, be entitled to compensation commensurate with the lost value of the use of the land. [2] A person described in subsection [1] may apply to the Authority for the compensation stating the nature of his legal interest in the burdened land and the compensation sought. [3] The Authority may require that the applicant for the environmental easement bear the cost of compensating the person described in subsection [1].
