Application of Act
(3) [1] This Act applies to the activities in respect of which the Minister, may, after screening them, prescribe by regulations. [2] Regulations made pursuant to subsection [1] shall prescribe [a] a list of activities which are likely to cause significant adverse effects on the environment, or the locations that may be environmentally sensitive, in respect of which a statement shall be mandatory; [b] threshold determinations of environmental impact assessment with respect to the activities prescribed under paragraph [a]; and [c] criteria which shall be used to determine the likely effects of a proposed activity in order to further determine whether or not a statement is required for the activity. [3] In this section, "screening" means an initial stage in the environmental impact assessment process where the Minister determines whether an activity should be subjected to an environmental impact assessment or not.

Requirements to undertake an activity
(4) [1] No person shall undertake or implement an activity prescribed under section 3 unless the environmental impact of the proposed activity is fully taken into account in accordance with the provisions of this Act and authorisation has been issued under section [14]. [2] Any person who undertakes or implements an activity in contravention of subsection [1] commits an offence and is liable to a fine not exceeding P100000 or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years or to both. [3] A person who contravenes subsection [1] shall rehabilitate the area affected by the adverse environmental impact of the implemented activity. [4] In this section, "rehabilitate" means the reinstatement or restoration to a normal or functional environmental state. [5] A person who contravenes subsection [3] commits an offence and is liable to a fine not exceeding P15000 or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 2 years or to both. [6] In the case of a continued contravention in respect of a person convicted under subsection [2] or [5], that person is liable to a further fine not exceeding P2000 for every day on which the offence continues.
