[2] If the President is satisfied, on the recommendation of the Minister, that such course would be in the interests of the public generally or in the interests of any section of the public, he may set aside State land or acquire other land for the improvement or proper management of the environment. [3] In the absence of agreement between the President and the owner of the land, the President may compulsorily acquire land for the purposes of subsection [2], and in that event the Land Acquisition Act [Chapter 20:10] shall apply, mutatis mutandis, in relation to the acquisition.

President may set aside areas of Communal Land for environmental purposes
(110) [1] The President may set aside any area of Communal Land for the conservation or improvement of natural resources or for the protection of irrigation works or sources of water supplies, provided that no such area shall be set aside until the Minister responsible for the administration of the Communal Land Act [Chapter 20:04] is satisfied that suitable provision has been made elsewhere for the inhabitants who will be affected by the setting aside of the area. [2] In the event of any conflict between regulations made in terms of section one hundred and forty in respect of any area set aside under subsection [1] and any bylaws or regulations that are applicable to the area in terms of the Communal Land Act [Chapter 20:04] or the Rural District Councils Act [Chapter 29:13], the regulations made under this Act shall prevail.

Minister may construct works
(111) [1] Notwithstanding any other law, the Minister may cause works to be constructed for the protection or management of the environment, if: [a] he considers the works to be necessary or desirable in the public interest; and [b] the authority or person responsible for the land has failed or refused to construct the works. [2] Without limiting the generality of subsection [1], the Minister may in terms of that subsection cause works to be constructed for any of the following purposes: [a] the preservation or protection of the bed, banks or course of a public stream or any source of water; and [b] the disposal or control of storm-water; and [c] the mitigation or prevention of soil erosion; and [d] the conservation of water; and [e] waste disposal and management; and [f] the control of water tables and the disposal of irrigation drainage water.

(112) [1] If, in regard to works constructed in terms of section one hundred and eleven, the Minister considers that: [a] any person will benefit from the works in his capacity as an owner, occupier or user of land or that construction of the works has been rendered necessary by the acts or omissions of any person in his capacity as an owner, occupier or user of land; and [b] having regard to all the circumstances, it is just and equitable that a person referred to in paragraph [a] should pay the whole or part of the cost of the works; the Minister may serve a written notice on the person calling on him to pay the State an amount specified in the notice, being an amount equal to the whole or part of the cost of the works, as the case may be. [2] If, within five years after serving a notice in terms of subsection [1], the Minister is satisfied that, because of changed circumstances, the person on whom the notice was served has benefited by the works concerned to a substantially greater or lesser extent than was apparent when the notice was served, the Minister may serve a further notice on the person increasing or decreasing, as the case may be, the amount which he is called upon to pay. [3] If a person on whom a notice has been served in terms of subsection [1] or [2] admits liability for the amount specified in the notice, or such other amount as he and the Minister may agree: [a] the amount so admitted shall be a debt due and payable by that person to the State; and [b] from the date on which the notice was served until the amount so admitted has been paid to the State, interest shall be paid on the outstanding amount at the prescribed rate, provided that, where a notice under subsection [2] has called upon the person to pay a lesser amount than an earlier notice, the amount of the debt shall be reduced accordingly, and the Minister shall cause the person to be refunded any excess he may have paid the State. [4] If a person on whom a notice has been served in terms of subsection [1] or [2] does not admit liability for the amount specified in the notice, the Minister may apply to the Administrative Court for an order compelling the person to pay the amount to the State, and if the Administrative Court is satisfied that: [a] the person benefited from the works concerned in his capacity as an owner, occupier or user of land or that construction of the works was rendered necessary by the person's acts or omissions in his capacity as an owner, occupier or user of land; and [b] having regard to all the circumstances, it is just and equitable that the person should pay the whole or part of the cost of the works concerned; the Administrative Court shall order that person to pay such amount as the Court considers just and equitable.

(113) [1] The Minister may declare any wetland to be an ecologically sensitive area and may impose limitations on development in or around such area. [2] No person shall, except in accordance with the express written authorization of the Agency, given in consultation with the Board and the Minister responsible for water resources: [a] reclaim or drain any wetland; [b] disturb any wetland by drilling or tunnelling in a manner that has or is likely to have an adverse impact on any wetland or adversely affect any animal or plant life therein; [c] introduce any exotic animal or plant species into the wetland. [3] Any person who contravenes subsection [2] shall be liable to a fine not exceeding level eight or imprisonment not exceeding two years or to both such fine and such imprisonment.

Minister may make order for protection of environment
