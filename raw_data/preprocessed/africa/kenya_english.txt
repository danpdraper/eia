PART IX - ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION ORDERS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION ORDERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EASEMENTS

(108) [1] Subject to any other provisions of this Act, the Authority may issue and serve on any person in respect of any matter relating to the management of the environment an order in this Part referred to as an environmental restoration order. [2] An environmental restoration order issued under subsection [1] or section 111 shall be issued to: [a] require the person on whom it is served to restore the environment as near as it may be to the state in which it was before the taking of the action which is the subject of the order; [b] prevent the person on whom it is served from taking any action which would or is reasonably likely to cause harm to the environment; [c] award compensation to be paid by the person on whom it is served to other persons whose environment or livelihood has been harmed by the action which is the subject of the order; [d] levy a charge on the person on whom it is served which in the opinion of the Authority represents a reasonable estimate of the costs of any action taken by an authorised person or organisation to restore the environment to the state in which it was before the taking of the action which is the subject of the order. [3] An environmental restoration order may contain such terms and conditions and impose such obligations on the persons on whom it is served as will, in the opinion of the Authority, enable the order to achieve all or any of the purposes set out in subsection [2]. [4] Without prejudice to the general effect of the purpose set out in subsection [2] an environmental restoration order may require a person on whom it is served to: [a] take such action as will prevent the commencement or continuation or cause of pollution; [b] restore land, including the replacement of soil, the replanting of trees and other flora and the restoration as far as may be, of outstanding geological, archaeological or historical features of the land or the area contiguous to the land or sea as may be specified in the particular order; [c] take such action to prevent the commencement or continuation or cause of environmental hazard; [d] cease to take any action which is causing or may contribute to causing pollution or an environmental hazard; [e] remove or alleviate any injury to land or the environment or to the amenities of the area; [f] prevent damage to the land or the environment, aquifers beneath the land and flora and fauna in, on or under or about the land or sea specified in the order or land or the environment contiguous to the land or sea specified in the order; [g] remove any waste or refuse deposited on the land or sea specified in the order and dispose of the same in accordance with the provisions of the order; [h] pay any compensation specified in the order. [5] In exercising the powers under this section, the Authority shall: [a] be guided by the principles of good environmental management in accordance with the provisions of this Act; and [b] explain the right of appeal of the persons against whom the order is issued to the Tribunal or if dissatisfied with the decision of the Tribunal, to superior courts.

(109) [1] An environmental restoration order shall specify clearly and in a manner which may be easily understood: [a] the activity to which it relates; [b] the person or persons to whom it is addressed; [c] the time at which it comes into effect; [d] the action which must be taken to remedy the harm to the environment and the time, being not more than thirty days or such further period as may be prescribed in the order within which the action must be taken; [e] the powers of the Authority to enter any land and undertake the action specified in paragraph [d]; [f] the penalties which may be imposed if the action specified in paragraph [d] is not undertaken; [g] the right of the person served with an environmental restoration order to appeal to the Tribunal against that order, except where the order is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, in which case the right of appeal shall lie with superior courts. [2] An Environmental Inspector of the Authority may inspect or cause to be inspected any activity to determine whether that activity is harmful to the environment and may take into account the evidence obtained from that inspection in any decision on whether or not to serve an environmental restoration order. [3] The Authority may seek and take into account any technical, professional and scientific advice which it considers to be desirable for a satisfactory decision to be made on an environmental restoration order. [4] An environmental restoration order shall continue to apply to the activity in respect of which it was served notwithstanding that it has been complied with. [5] A person served with an environmental restoration order shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, comply with all the terms and conditions of the order that has been served on him. [6] It shall not be necessary for the Authority or its Inspectors in exercising the powers under subsection [2], to give any person conducting or involved in the activity which is the subject of the inspection or residing or working on or developing land on which the activity which is the subject of the inspection is taking place, an opportunity of being heard by or making representations to the person conducting the inspection.

(110) [1] At any time within twenty-one days after the service of an environmental restoration order, a person upon whom the order has been served may, by giving reasons in writing, request the Authority to re-consider that order. [2] Where the Authority exercises the power under subsection [1], the expenses necessarily incurred by it in the exercise of that power shall be a civil debt recoverable summarily by it from the person referred to in subsection [1].

(111) [1] Without prejudice to the powers of the Authority under this Act, a court of competent jurisdiction may, in proceedings brought by any person, issue an environmental restoration order against a person who has harmed, is harming or is reasonably likely to harm the environment. [2] For the avoidance of doubt, it shall not be necessary for a plaintiff under this section to show that he has a right or interest in the property, environment or land alleged to have been or likely to be harmed.

(112) [1] A court may, on an application made under this Part, grant an environmental easement or an environmental conservation order subject to the provisions of this Act. [2] The object of an environmental easement is to further the principles of environmental management set out in this Act by facilitating the conservation and enhancement of the environment, in this Act referred to as the benefited environment, through the imposition of one or more obligations in respect of the use of land, in this Act referred to as the burdened land, being the land in the vicinity of the benefited environment. [3] An environmental easement may be imposed on and shall thereafter attach to the burdened land in perpetuity or for a term of years or for an equivalent interest under customary law as the court may determine. [4] Without prejudice to the general effect of subsection [2], an environmental conservation order may be imposed on burdened land so as to: [a] preserve flora and fauna; [b] preserve the quality and flow of water in a dam, lake, river or aquifer; [c] preserve any outstanding geological, physiological, ecological, archeological, or historical features of the burdened land; [d] preserve scenic view; [e] preserve open space; [f] permit persons to walk in a defined path across the burdened land; [g] preserve the natural contours and features of the burdened land; [h] prevent or restrict the scope of any activity on the burdened land which has as its object the mining and working of minerals or aggregates; [i] prevent or restrict the scope of any agricultural activity on the burdened land; [j] create and maintain works on burdened land so as to limit or prevent harm to the environment; or [k] create or maintain migration corridors for wildlife. [5] Where an environmental easement is imposed on burdened land on which any person has at the time of the imposition of the easement, any existing right or interest to the land and that environmental easement will restrict that right or interest, there shall be paid to that person, by the applicant for the environmental easement such compensation as may be determined in accordance with section 116. [6] An environmental easement may exist in gross; that is to say, the validity and enforceability of the easement shall not be dependent on the existence of a plot of land in the vicinity of the burdened land which can be benefited or, of a person with an interest in that plot of land who can be benefited by the environmental easement.

(113) [1] A person or a group of persons may make an application to the court for the grant of one or more environmental easements. [2] The court may impose such conditions on the grant of an environmental easement as it considers to be best calculated to advance the object of an environmental easement.

(114) [1] Proceedings to enforce an environmental easement may be commenced only by the person in whose name the environmental easement has been issued. Proceedings to enforce an environmental easement may request the court to: [a] grant an environmental restoration order; [b] grant any remedy available under the law relating to easements in respect of land. [2] The court shall have a discretion to adapt and adjust, so far as seems necessary to it, the law and procedures relating to the enforcement of the requirements of an environmental easement.

(115) [1] Where an environmental easement is imposed on land, the title of which is registered under a particular system of land registration, the environmental easement shall be registered in accordance with the provisions of the Act applicable to that particular system of registration for easements. [2] Where an environmental easement is imposed on any land other than land referred to in subsection [1], the District Environment Committee of the area in which that land is situated shall register the environmental easement on a register maintained for that purpose in accordance with the provisions of this Act. [3] In addition to any matter which may be required by any law relating to the registration of easements in respect of land, the registration of an environmental easement shall include the name of the applicant for the environmental easement as the person in whose name the environmental easement is registered.

(116) [1] Any person who has a legal interest in the land which is the subject of an environmental easement, shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, be entitled to compensation commensurate with the lost value of the use of the land. [2] A person described in subsection [1] may apply to the court that granted the environmental easement for compensation stating the nature of his legal interest in the burdened land and the compensation sought. [3] The court may require the applicant for the environmental easement to bear the cost of compensating the person described in subsection [1]. [4] The court may, if satisfied that the environmental easement sought is of national importance, order that the Government compensates the person described in subsection [1]. [5] The court in determining the compensation due under this section shall take into account the relevant provisions of the Constitution and any other laws relating to compulsory acquisition of land. 

PART X - INSPECTION, ANALYSIS AND RECORDS
