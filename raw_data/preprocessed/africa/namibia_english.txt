Entry and inspection
(19) [1] In this section “member of the police” means a member of the Namibian Police Force as defined in section 1 of the Police Act, 1990 (Act No. 19 of 1990). [2] To the extent that this section authorises the interference with the privacy of persons homes, correspondence or communications as contemplated in Article 13(1) of the Namibian Constitution, this section is enacted on the authority of Sub-Article [2] of that Article. [3] An environmental officer may, on the authority of a warrant issued in terms of subsection [5][a] in order to obtain evidence, enter premises where he or she has reason to believe that any provision of this Act has been or is being contravened; [b] direct the person in control of or employed at the premises [i] to deliver any book, record or other document that relates to the investigation and which is in the possession or under the control of that person; [ii] to furnish such information as he or she has with regard to that matter; and [iii] to render such assistance as the environmental officer requires in order to enable him or her to perform his or her duties or functions under this Act; [c] inspect any book, record or other document and make copies of it or excerpts from it; [d] seize any, material, substance, book, record or other document which is or may be relevant to a prosecution under this Act and keep it in his or her custody, but the person from whose possession or control any book, record or document has been taken, may, at his or her own expense and under supervision of the environmental officer concerned, make copies of it or excerpts from it; and [e] take samples of any material or substance seized in terms of paragraph [d], for analysis.

[5] A warrant referred to in subsection [3] must be issued by a judge of the High Court or by a magistrate who has jurisdiction in the area where the premises in question are situated, and may only be issued if it appears from information on oath that there are reasonable grounds for believing that any material, substance or other things contemplated in subsection [3] is on or in such premises, and must specify which of the acts mentioned in that subsection may be performed in terms of the warrant by the person to whom it is issued. [6] Any environmental officer executing a warrant in terms of this section must immediately before commencing the execution [a] identify himself or herself to the person in control of the premises, if such person is present, and hand to such person a copy of the warrant or, if such person is not present, affix such copy in a prominent place on the premises; and [b] supply such person at the request of such person, with particulars regarding his or her authority to execute such a warrant. [7] A person may not enter or search any premises unless he has audibly demanded admission to the premises and has notified the purpose of his or her entry, unless such person is, on reasonable grounds, of the opinion that any material, substance or other things contemplated in subsection [3] may be destroyed if such admission is first demanded and such purpose is first notified. [8] Any entry and search in terms of this section must be executed by day, unless the execution of it by night is justifiable and necessary. [9] A warrant contemplated in this section may be issued on any day and is effective until [a] it is executed; [b] it is cancelled by the person who issued it or, if such person is not available, by any person with similar authority; [c] one month from the date of its issue; or [d] the purpose for which the warrant was issued, no longer exists, whichever occurs first. [10] An environmental officer may without a warrant enter on any premises and search for, seize and remove anything referred to in subsection [3], if [a] the person who is competent to do so consents to such entry, search, seizure and removal; or [b] there are reasonable grounds to believe that [i] a warrant would be issued to the environmental officer if he applied for such warrant; and [ii] the delay in obtaining such warrant would defeat the purpose of the search. [11] A material or substance seized in terms of this section must be dealt with as contemplated in Chapter 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act. 

Compliance orders
(20) [1] For the purpose of this section “exceptional circumstances” includes circumstances in which the delay necessary to issue a written order that meets the requirements of subsection [2] would result in danger to human life or the environment.

[3] A compliance order must set out [a] the name of the person to whom the order applies; [b] the provision or condition which has been contravened; [c] details of the nature and extent of the contravention; [d] any steps that are required to be taken and the period within which those steps must be taken; and [e] any penalty that may be imposed in terms of this Act if those steps are not taken; [f] the procedure to be followed in lodging an objection to the compliance order with the Minister; and [g] any other prescribed matter. [4] In exceptional circumstances a compliance order may be given orally, but within a period of seven days after such order is given, a written order must be issued in accordance with subsection [3]. [5] A person who receives a compliance order must comply with that order within the time period stated in the order unless the Minister has agreed to suspend the operation of the compliance order under section [21][6] Where a person fails to take any measures specified in the compliance order without raising an objection an environmental officer may take the measures or cause them to be taken. [7] Any costs incurred by the environmental officer in connection with any action taken under subsection [6] may be recovered from the person referred to in that subsection as a debt owing to the State. [8] Any person who, without good reason, fails or refuses to comply with a compliance order commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding N$500000 or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 25 years or to both such fine and such imprisonment. 

Objections to compliance order
(21) [1] Any person issued with an order in terms of section 20, may apply to the Minister in the prescribed form and manner for the review of the order within [a] 14 days after receiving that order; or [b] such longer period as may be allowed by the Minister on good cause shown. [2] After considering the application made in terms of subsection [1], and any other relevant information, the Minister may confirm, modify or cancel all or part of the order. [3] If the Minister confirms or modifies all or part of a compliance order, the applicant must comply with that order as confirmed or modified, within the time period specified in it. [4] The Environmental Commissioner must in the prescribed form and manner notify the person referred to in subsection [1], of the decision made in terms of subsection [2] and the reasons for the decision.

Environmental plans
(24) [1] For the purpose of this Part, the Minister may identify and list by notice in the Gazette or by regulation organs of state which are exercising functions that may affect the environment.

[3] Where the environmental plan is approved by the Minister, the relevant organ of state must adopt and publish its plan in the Gazette within 90 days of the approval and the plan becomes effective from the date of publication. [4] The exercise of functions by organs of state may not be delayed or postponed on account of [a] the failure of any organ of state to submit an environmental plan; [b] the scrutiny of any environmental plan by the Environmental Commissioner; [c] the amendment of any environmental plan following scrutiny of the plan by the Environmental Commissioner; or [d] the failure of any organ of state to adopt and publish its environmental plan. 

Compliance with environmental plans
(26) [1] Every organ of state must exercise every function it may have, or that has been assigned or delegated to it, by or under any law, and that may significantly affect the protection of the environment, substantially in accordance with the environmental plan prepared and approved in accordance with this Part, but any substantial deviation from an environmental plan must be reported to the Environmental Commissioner. [2] Every organ of state identified and listed in terms of section 24[1] must report annually to the Minister on the implementation of its adopted environmental plan. [3] The Environmental Commissioner monitors compliance with environmental plans and may [a] take any steps or make any inquiries the Commissioner considers necessary in order to determine if environmental implementation plans are being complied with by organs of state; and [b] if, as a result of any steps taken or inquiry made under paragraph [a], the Commissioner is satisfied that an environmental implementation plan is not substantially being complied with, serve a written notice on the organ of state concerned, calling on it to take such specified steps as the Commissioner considers necessary to remedy the non-compliance. [4] A copy of every environmental plan must be made available for public inspection, without charge, at the office of the Environmental Commissioner during office hours. 

PART VII - ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
